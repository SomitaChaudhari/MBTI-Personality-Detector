            <div class="whois">WHO IS A COMMANDER (ENTJ)?</div> <br>
            A Commander (ENTJ) is someone with the Extraverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Judging personality traits. They are decisive people who love momentum and accomplishment.
            They gather information to construct their creative visions but rarely hesitate for long before acting on them.
            <br>
         </p>
         <p class="introduction-2">
            Commanders are natural-born leaders. People with this personality type embody the gifts of charisma and confidence, and project authority in a way that draws crowds together behind a common goal. 
            However, Commanders are also characterized by an often ruthless level of rationality, using their drive, determination and sharp minds to achieve whatever end they’ve set for themselves. 
            Perhaps it is best that they make up only three percent of the population, lest they overwhelm the more timid and sensitive personality types that make up much of the rest of the world – 
            but we have Commanders to thank for many of the businesses and institutions we take for granted every day.

                <li>People with this personality type enjoy spending time with other people. They have strong verbal skills and interacting with others helps them feel energized.</li>
                <li>ENTJ types prefer to think about the future rather than focus on the here-and-now. They usually find abstract and theoretical information more interesting than concrete details.</li>
                <li>When making decisions, ENTJs place a greater emphasis on objective and logical information. Personal feelings and the emotions of others tend not to factor much into their choices.</li>
                <li>ENTJs are planners. Making decisions and having a schedule or course of action planned out gives them a sense of predictability and control.</li>
                <li>They are highly rational, good at spotting problems, and excel at taking charge. These tendencies make them natural leaders who are focused on efficiently solving problems.</li>
                <li>ENTJs are not necessarily good with emotions, but that does not mean they are intentionally cruel. They are prone to hiding their own emotions and sentimentality, viewing it as a weakness that should not be made known to others.</li>

            <h2 class="cognitive-heading">COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS</h2>
            <div class="cogintro">
                Based upon the Jungian personality theory, the MBTI suggests that personality is composed of several different cognitive functions. These functions can be focused primarily outward (extraverted) or inward (introverted).
            </div>
            <div class="cogheading">Dominant: Extraverted Thinking</div><br>
            <div class="cogintro">
                ENTJs tend to speak first without listening, making snap judgments before really taking in all the information about a situation.<br>
                While they tend to make snap judgments, they are also very rational and objective. They are focused on imposing order and standards on the world around them. Setting measurable goals is important.
            </div>
            <div class="cogheading">Auxiliary: Introverted Intuition</div><br>
            <div class="cogintro">
                People with this personality type are future-focused and always consider the possibilities when approaching a decision.<br>
                ENTJs are forward-thinking and are not afraid of change. They trust their instincts, although they tend to regret jumping to conclusions so quickly.
            </div>
            <div class="cogheading">Tertiary: Extraverted Sensing</div><br>
            <div class="cogintro">
                This cognitive function gives ENTJs an appetite for adventure. They enjoy novel experiences and may sometimes engage in thrill-seeking behaviors.<br>
                Because of their outward sensory focus, they also have an appreciation for beautiful things in life. They often enjoy surrounding themselves with things that they find attractive or interesting.
            </div>
            <div class="cogheading">Inferior: Introverted Feeling</div><br>
            <div class="cogintro">
                Introverted feeling is centered on internal feelings and values. Emotions can be difficult area for ENTJs, and they often lack an understanding of how this part of their personality contributes to their decision-making process.<br>
                When this aspect of personality is weak, ENTJs may find themselves feeling uncomfortable or awkward in settings where some type of emotional response is called for.
