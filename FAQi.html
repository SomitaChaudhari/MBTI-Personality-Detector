            <h15>What is the MBTI® instrument?</h15>

        </div>
        <div class="panel">
            <p> The Myers‐Briggs Type Indicator® (MBTI®) instrument is a personality assessment designed to be useful in
                both work and everyday life. It helps people identify four basic personality preferences that combine to
                form their individual MBTI® personality type. Understanding your MBTI® results can help you understand
                and appreciate the natural differences in the ways people think, communicate, and interact—differences
                that can be the source of much misunderstanding. Drawn from Carl Jung’s theory of psychological types and refined through decades of research, the MBTI®
                instrument has been used for more than 70 years to establish greater self‐knowledge and interpersonal
                understanding among people of all ages and backgrounds. It has been translated into more than 20
                different languages for use around the world.  </p>

            <h15>Is the MBTI® instrument valid and reliable?</h15>

        </div>
        <div class="panel">
            <p> Yes. The instrument’s reliability has been proven statistically and its validity has been firmly established in
                hundreds of separate studies. Reliability refers to whether the results are consistent: Do people tend to
                reply to the items in the same way when they complete the assessment at a later time and do they tend
                to get the same four‐letter type? Can you count on the results? Validity refers to the instrument’s ability to
                identify psychological types according to Carl Jung’s theory.  </p>

                <h15>What do the letters associated with the MBTI® instrument mean? </h15>
    
            </div>
            <div class="panel">
                <p> The MBTI® instrument helps people discover and understand their personality type by identifying their
                    preferences between four pairs of opposites. Each of the opposite preferences is represented by a
                    specific letter:
                    <br>Extraversion (E) or Introversion (I): Your preference indicates whether you tend to focus on and draw
                    energy from people and activity “outside yourself” (E) or your own inner world of thought and
                    reflection (I).
                    <br> Sensing (S) or Intuition (N): Your preference indicates whether you tend to focus on information that’s
                    real and tangible (S) or to take in the big picture and the connections between facts (N).
                    <br> Thinking (T) or Feeling (F): Your preference indicates whether you tend to make decisions through
                    logical analysis (T) or by considering what is important to you and to other people involved (F).
                    <br> Judging (J) or Perceiving (P): Your preference indicates whether  </p>

                <h15>Can I fake my responses so my type will come out a certain way? </h15>
    
            </div>
            <div class="panel">
                <p> Yes, but why would you want to? If you’re familiar with the eight preferences pairs of the MBTI®
                    instrument and want your assessment to come out in a certain way, you can probably respond in such a
                    way as to either conform to a certain type or come close. But faking your responses won’t give you
                    information that can help you increase your self‐awareness, improve your decision making, get along with
                    others better, develop as a leader, find work you enjoy and enhance your
                    relationships. So most people choose to respond honestly when completing the assessment.  </p>

                <h15> What is psychological type / personality type? </h15>
    
            </div>
            <div class="panel">
                <p> Psychological type is a concept developed by Swiss psychologist Carl Jung (1875–1961), who described
                    different patterns of normal behaviour resulting from people’s inherent tendency to use their minds in
                    different ways. Your psychological type, also called “personality type,” is the pattern of behaviour you tend
                    to show. In the Myers‐Briggs Type Indicator® instrument, your type is indicated by your preferences
                    between Extraversion or Introversion, Sensing or Intuition, Thinking or Feeling, and Judging or Perceiving.
                    Your four preferences combine to form one of 16 distinct personality types, each of which is denoted by
                    a four‐letter type code (ENFP, ISTJ, etc.)  </p>

                <h15>Is there a best and worst personality type? </h15>
    
            </div>
            <div class="panel">
                <p> No. As Isabel Briggs Myers wrote in the Introduction to Myers-Briggs® Type booklet, "There is no right or
                    wrong type and there are no better or worse combinations of types in work or relationships. Each type
                    and each individual bring special gifts."  </p>
                               
            </div>

                <div class="icon"></div>
                <h15>Is personality type related to emotional intelligence? </h15>
    
            </div>
            <div class="panel">
                <p> Yes, in a way. Emotional Intelligence (EQ) generally refers to one’s ability to manage impulses, empathize
                    with others and show resilience in the face of stress or obstacles. EQ is often divided into two categories:
                    intrapersonal (your ability to control yourself internally in a positive way) and interpersonal (your skills in
                    getting along with others). Personality type, as identified by the MBTI® instrument, is also concerned with
                    internal and external processes, and thus can be a very useful tool for enhancing and developing
                    emotional intelligence.  </p>

                <h15>Does the MBTI® instrument stereotype people? </h15>
    
            </div>
            <div class="panel">
                <p> >No. The MBTI® assessment does not stereotype people. Among the basic principles of the instrument, as
                    stated in the Introduction to Myers-Briggs® Type booklet written by Isabel Briggs Myers, are the following:
                  <br>  - Each type has special gifts.
                   <br> - Each person is unique and expresses type in a unique way.
                   <br> - There is no good or bad type.
                   <br> - You are the final judge of your own psychological type; your MBTI® results suggest your type based on
                   <br> your responses, but the individual is the final judge of his or her own type.
                   <br> - Type does not explain everything; humans are complex.
                   <br> - Type may be used to understand and forgive, but never as an excuse.
                   <br> - By becoming aware of your own type biases, you can avoid negative stereotyping.  </p>

                <h15>How will knowing my personality type help me? </h15>
    
            </div>
            <div class="panel">
                <p> Knowing your type will help you better understand yourself and your behaviours. It will also help you
                    appreciate others’ styles and thus enable you to deal more constructively with the differences between
                    you and other people. With a greater understanding of your own inherent strengths, you will be better
                    able to take advantage of opportunities to use those strengths for more effective functioning in work and
                    life. Many individuals have used their understanding of their MBTI® type to help them find a satisfying job,
                    choose an academic major, improve their effectiveness and satisfaction at work and enhance their
                    interactions and relationships with others.  </p>

                <h15> Will my type change over time?</h15>
    
            </div>
            <div class="panel">
                <p> No. Because your type is inherent, your basic preferences likely will not change. However, type develops
                    over a person’s lifespan.Jung theorized that people have an innate urge to grow and have everything they need within
                    themselves to become healthy, effective individuals. Psychological type is the compass guiding this
                    growth process.    </p>

            </div>
            <div class="panel">
                <p> The MBTI® instrument is a self‐report tool ‐ it gives you answers based on what you report about yourself
                    ‐ so in one sense, it won’t tell you anything that you don’t already know. But knowing something and being
                    able to use it effectively in your life are two vastly different things. Most people enjoy completing the
                    MBTI® assessment, and when they get their results, they feel affirmed in that they’ve received an accurate
                    description of their personality. Many go on to set new goals and improve their decision making and
                    relationships.   </p>

                <h15>How can knowing my personality type help me get along better with other people? </h15>
    
            </div>
            <div class="panel">
                <p> Myers and Briggs created the MBTI® instrument because they wanted to help people understand
                    themselves and others better and appreciate the differences between them. When you complete the
                    MBTI® assessment and review your results, you learn that there are different ways of interacting with
                    others, taking in information, making decisions and organising one’s life. That information can help you
                    better understand your friends, co‐workers and family, and improve your interpersonal interactions  </p>
                               
            </div>

                <div class="icon"></div>
                <h15> Will my type tell me what I’m good at doing?</h15>
    
            </div>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>  No. The MBTI® instrument does not measure competencies in the way a mathematics test can measure
                    your maths skills, for example. None of the MBTI® questions are designed to determine how good you
                    are at a particular task.However, a lot of research exists about what careers people of particular personality types tend to enter
                    and what kinds of tasks they tend to enjoy. For example, research has shown that INTPs and INTJs tend to
                    like the theoretical work of science and ESFPs and ESFJs tend to enjoy tasks that involve helping others.
                    So completing the MBTI® assessment may give you an insight into what kind of work you enjoy, and
                    people who enjoy their work often do better at it. </p>

                <h15>Should I choose a career based on my MBTI® type? </h15>
    
            </div>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>  No, not based on your type alone. Career decisions are usually most sound when they take into account
                    a number of factors, including interests, personality, skills, values, lifestyle needs and others. Knowing
                    your MBTI® type can help you in career decision making, but it should not be the only factor you
                    consider.
                    Research shows that people of each personality type tend to choose particular career fields and are likely
                    to avoid certain other fields. You may want to consult current career books on the subject or work with a
                    career counsellor who is certified to use the MBTI® instrument to learn more about type and career
                    choices.  </p>
